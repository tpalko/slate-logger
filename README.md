## What does Cowpy do?

Cowpy is a drop-in replacement for Python's `logging` with the additional benefits of:

- colorized logging
- easy setting of context/state
- intelligent auto-naming of loggers
- external, hierarchical logging configuration


### development 

* should we wrap the static loggers.. keep a handle on each logger requested and actually use the instance of Cowpy as the logging object in calling code?
